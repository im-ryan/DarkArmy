# DarkArmy

This application was created for Cypress College in collaboration with Magnolia High School's CS3 Squared program. The goal was to have a simple and engaging activity to help students learn about Social Engineering. The game board needed to be simple so that anyone (read: non-technical people) can just download it, double click it, and play with their students over a Zoom session.

## Getting Started

Download the "darkarmy.html" file and double click it. If your computer doesn't know what to do with .html files, just make sure your preferred browser opens it.
